# VIMS
The Vault Inventory Management System, made in Google Apps Script to maintain an inventory of approx 200 items.

The VIMS was created during my time in undergrad, as part of a student worker position. This package maintains an inventory in a number of spreadsheets in a Google Drive, and automatically emails reciepts of the various transaction types to customers. The software is meant to run from a single client computer, and does not contain many configuration options.
